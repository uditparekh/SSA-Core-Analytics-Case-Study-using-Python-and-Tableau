 2) Prompt questions: You are to present summary analysis to the VP of Go-To-Market on the health of different regions for the past two quarters. The VP wants the following questions answered:     
a)	What’s the total RSE by each region and segment?  
b)	What’s the average life cycle by each region?  
c)	What’s the average deal size by each region? Does classifying them into small/big or any more categories help us find better trends?
